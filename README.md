# Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple timer GUI to track time coding and create invoices for clients. 

I wrote this code using Java and many of its libraries. 

I have recently started doing some consulting work for different clients, and I need a better way to track my time as I code in RStudio. There were no satisfactory coding timers for RStudio, so I decided to create my own.

# Development Environment

I explored using IntelliJ or other dedicated Java IDE's, but since I was already familiar with VSCode, I ended up sticking with it for this project. 

This was written in Java using some text libraries (for writing the files) and the swing library (for creating the gui). 

# Useful Websites

The following websites were helpful as I worked to learn how to develop this code: 

- [Creating a GUI in Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5118701/how-to-create-a-gui-in-java)
- [Creating a timer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10820033/make-a-simple-timer-in-java)
- [Reading and Writing to Files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2885173/how-do-i-create-a-file-and-write-to-it)

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to add the following features to the timer: 

- Add a pause button and feature
- Add multiple project timers
- Create more professional looking invoices
